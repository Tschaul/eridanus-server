# Iridanus-server
Server for Iridanus

# Remaining Todos for MVP scope

- scrapping industry to metal
- notifications for important events
- send notifications via email

# Further Improvements

- highlight fleets without orders
- help: context based links into docs

# Roadmap and ideas

## Battle tactics

multiple different attack modes per fleet/world

- Weighted random (default behavior)
- Focus smallest
- Focus biggest
- Focus fleets
- Focus world industry
- Focus world ships
- Focus world population

## Research

- Research gets gathered proportional to population over time
- Research can be spent on 5 trees with five colors similar to MTG colors
- Researched upgrades effect all fleets/worlds instantly
- Only a total of 5 upgrades can be purchased per game

Possible Upgrades:

cooldown for most abilities: ~1 week

white
- ?
- armor: a low percentage of damage is constantly absorbed
- warp bomb: worlds can send bombs (like probes) that do AoE damage to all ships in probed system

blue
- speed: warping takes only a portion of the time
- cloak: ships that are not attacking (on cooldown) and idle can not be seen by the enemy
- vision: all neighboring systems are constantly 'probed' for free

black
- stim: costs ships and decreases weapon cooldown for a period of time
- bomb: instant damage to worlds (industry, ships, population)
- sacrifice: Does AoE to all fleets including own ones

red
- charge: instant extra damage proportional to normal damage
- weapons: permanently increase normal damage by low percentage
- storm: deals damage to all enemy ships in the system

green
- blink: fleets can attack instantly after arrival with an increased damage output
- repair: a fraction of destroyed ships per fleet get regenerated with a time delay
- reflection: Deals damage to enemies proportional of there total fleet ships

more ideas for upgrades:

- building industry is cheaper
- fleets can transport more metal
- instant strike: when enagaging the enemy ships fire once instantly
- sacrifice population to get extra metal from mines
